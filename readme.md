# this is some sort of an "Adventskalender" that I wrote nearly a decade from now (Mar 2017 actually).
This thing had gone viral at the university I studied that time. Many students had to pass a test where they had to write that sort of an "Adventskalender", and all those students "used" my ... lets call it implementation of that kind.
Even after several years I received emails from students that just wanted to thank me for writing and publishing this ;)

This "project" is just for entertainment purposes. I today wouldn't even think about writing that messed up code. I don't even know if that "Adventskalender" works, to be hones.
